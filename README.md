# Team-workflow-with-Git-and-GitHub: Study

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this, you should know:

- How to share code with collaborators
- What are branches
- Benefits of using a separate `dev` branch
- What are feature branches
- Naming conventions for feature branches
- Only one person needs to create a project repo
- One person as the integration manager should be responsible for checking and accepting pull requests
- When should you use `git merge`
- Differences between the Centralized, Feature Branch, Gitflow, and Forking Workflow

By the end of this, you should be able to:

- Create different branches in a Git repo
- Switch between branches
- Merge changes between branches
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Create a forked repo for the project
- Open a pull request from their fork to the main repo for their feature branch to be merged into the `dev` branch
- As the person responsible for checking and accepting pull requests, merge `dev` into `main` branch using `git merge` or opening -and closing a pull request
- Use branches and pull requests to isolate changes tied to specific features
- Add `upstream` to the local forked repo
- Pull changes from the upstream `main` branch
- Check their local repo is connected to the correct GitHub repo
- Request code review on a pull request from team members
- Discuss code on GitHub by leaving detailed comments
